MKDoc::Text::Structured
=======================


SUMMARY

MKDoc::Text::Structured is a library which allows very simple
text construct to be turned into HTML. These constructs are the ones
you would be using when writing a text email or newsgroup message.

MKDoc::Text::Structured follows the KISS philosophy. Comparing with
similar modules which try to implement as many HTML constructs as possible,
this module is incredibly restrictive, minimalistic and conservative.

And in fact that's why we use it :)
