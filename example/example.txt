MKDoc::Text::Structured
======================

MKDoc::Text::Structured is a module which turns structured text
into clean XHTML. This current piece of text is a valid structured
text fragment.

As you can see, MKDoc::Text::Structured has been designed to be
as *simple* and as *natural to use* as possible: you use it how
you would type a text email or a newsgroups post.

MKDoc::Text::Structured supports a few simple constructs:


Unordered Bulleted lists
------------------------

* This is a list.
* It has some elements.

* You can also have extra carriage returns between bullet points.


Ordered bullets lists
---------------------

1. Same as above

65451. The number doesn't matter

1. As long as each sentence starts with number dot space


Miscelleanous
-------------

MKDoc::Text::Structured allows you to /emphasize on certain
expressions/. Even though you can use slashes, the module should
be intelligent enough not to emphasize anything if you're talking
about the popular website /. See? /. /. /..

Also URLs should be OK: 

* http://example.com/foo/ (not emphasized)
* /http://example.com/foo//

By the way, you can also use underscores instead of slashes.
_this is emphasized too, you see_.

Symetrically, you can use stars to *put things in bold*.
Again you should be pretty safe:

    3*3*2 = 18

Lastly, you cannot do hyperlinks with this module. It will be
the job of another MKDoc module.
